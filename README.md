# VFX_Galaxy
Interactive Galaxy is a living, in-browser cosmos you can bend to your will. Watch a particle galaxy drift in a slow, hypnotic spiral—then dial in the Radius and Force sliders and unleash pinpoint stellar bursts exactly where you click. Stars and constellations rip outward, arcing across the void with physically-inspired motion that flips serenity into spectacle.

Hands-on control: Two simple sliders (top-left) shape the blast size and strength.

One-click fireworks: Click anywhere on the galaxy to trigger an explosion at your cursor.

From zen to chaos: Let it rotate peacefully… or turn the sky into kinetic art.

Best enjoyed in fullscreen on desktop. Tune the parameters, time your click, and watch the night scatter—then settle back into orbit, ready for the next burst.
